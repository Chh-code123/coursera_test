<p>Definition of computer-> A computer is a device that accepts information (in the
form of digitalized data) and manipulates it for some result based on a program or
sequence of instructions on how the data is to be processed. Complex computers also
include the means for storing data (including the program, which is also a form of
data) for some necessary duration. A program may be invariable and built into the
computer (and called logic circuitry as it is on microprocessors) or different programs
may be provided to the computer (loaded into its storage and then started by an
administrator or user). Today's computers have both kinds of programming.
