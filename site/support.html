	<p style="text-align: left;">A class is a user defined data type. A class is a logical abstraction. It is a template that defines the form of an object. A class specifies both code and data. It is not until an object of that class has been
		created that a physical representation of that class exists in memory. When you define a class, you
declare the data that it contains and the code that operates on that data. Data is contained in instance
variables defined by the class known as data members, and code is contained in functions known as
member functions. The code and data that constitute a class are called members of the class.</p>
